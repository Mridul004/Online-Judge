Online Judge - Project Description
This project aims to build a comprehensive online platform for practicing and improving your coding skills through curated programming challenges. It empowers both individual learners and competitive programmers with various features to test their knowledge and track their progress.

Key Features:

Problem Bank: Explore a diverse collection of programming challenges categorized by difficulty, topic, and company tags. Discover problems relevant to your learning goals and career aspirations.
Integrated Code Editor: Write and test your solutions directly within the platform. Enjoy syntax highlighting and language support for popular programming languages, providing a smooth coding experience.
Automated Testing: Validate your code against multiple test cases to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Observe error messages and gain valuable insights into your solutions.
Performance Analysis: Analyze the time and space complexity of your code to understand its resource usage and potential optimizations. Identify areas for improvement and refine your problem-solving skills.
Submissions and Leaderboard: Track your progress by submitting solutions and compare your performance with others on the leaderboard. Earn badges and climb the ranks as you master different challenges.
Discussion Forum (Optional): Engage with the community by sharing solutions, asking questions, and exchanging knowledge. Build a network of support and learn from fellow coders.
User Authentication and Profiles (Optional): Create a secure account to personalize your experience, track solved problems, and access additional features. (Optional)
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Choose a popular frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
Backend: Opt for a robust backend framework like Node.js with Express for efficient API development and database management.
Database: Select a scalable database like MongoDB to store problem data, user information, and submission history.
